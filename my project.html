            <h1>The Best Reincarnation Manhwa <br> Where FL was Reborn</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        List of strictly manga. Where the main character is either reincarnated into another world with memories of the previous life intact or where he is swept into another world. Sometimes with a purpose, sometimes not, but typically where they must learn to survive or adapt.Some of the manga are second chance at the same life but they seem pretty close to reincarnation since they retain their memories so i added them in. There is no particular order to these but i do enjoy the top ten most over the others in this list.

            I entered the body of Niveia Herbert, the only daughter of God in the kingdom, who was offered as a sacrifice.

She sacrificed herself as the eldest daughter of my family for them, lost my fiancée to my rival, and gave my life as a believer for the kingdom... there was just calamities upon calamities happening.

"There's no point in dying. Fuck the sacrifice."
Destroying her death flag and aiming a bow that will change her fate to fight God, the final boss!

“So the actions I’m taking to save my life are evil?” She lifted the corner of her mouth and laughed.

“If that’s the case, I'd be happy to be a villainess."
